  utter_QPdefinition:
  - text: Q P stands for Quota Premium, also known as the cost price of C O E. LTA does not set the C O E prices. They are determined by market supply and demand over open bidding exercises.If you are still on this topic, here are some questions that may interest you.

  utter_coeEarly:
  - text: Great! You can renew the C O E of your vehicle before the expiry month of the 10-year C O E. The new C O E will start from the first of the month following the renewal month and the balance unused period of the current C O E will be forfeited. Shall I go on?
  - text: Well, you can choose to renew your 10-year C O E before the expiry month. But your new C O E will start from the first of the month following the renewal month and the balance unused period of the current C O E will be forfeited. Shall I go on?

To renew online at One Motoring, you can make payment via e NETS Debit. Or if you wish to renew by post, you can make payment via cheque or cashiers order.If you are still on this topic, below listed are some relevant topics you can ask me about.

  utter_pqpDefinition:
  - text: P Q P is the moving average of C O E prices in the last 3 months. It varies monthly, depending on the C O E prices of the bidding exercises in the last 3 months. Months in which no bidding was conducted are excluded from the calculation. You can find out the P Q P for each month once the 2nd bidding exercise in the previous month is over.If this helps, here are some other terms that i can explain to you.

  utter_tcoeCancellation:
  - text: A Temporary C O E cannot be cancelled. The Temporary C O E is the result of a successful bid which not only contributes to the setting of the C O E Quota Premium but also deprives another person from obtaining a C O E at the same exercise. Hence, a prospective vehicle owner must be prepared to use the Temporary C O E that is successfully bid under his or her name to register the vehicle by the Temporary C O E expiry date. If the owner chooses not to use the Temporary C O E for whatever reason and the Temporary C O E expires, the bid deposit will be forfeited. What other questions do you have for me?

  utter_coeDefinition:
  - text: C O E stands for Certificate of Entitlement. It represents a right to vehicle ownership for 10 years. The Vehicle Quota System was introduced to control the vehicle population at levels that can be supported by road infrastructure development and planned developments in public transport and traffic management measures. The Vehicle Quota System sets a quota to the number of new vehicles to be registered in Singapore each year. Under the Vehicle Quota System, anyone who wants to register a vehicle will need to first bid for a C O E through the open bidding exercises. Upon expiry of the C O E, the owner will need to renew the C O E for another 5 or 10 years if he wishes to keep the vehicle in Singapore beyond 10 years.

  utter_needTCoe:
  - text: The C O E bidding exercises will resume in July 2020, starting with the first bidding exercise on Monday, 6 July 2020.
